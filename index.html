        <h1>Why I took this class</h1>
        <p>I took this class because I wanted to get an early learning experience of programming and markup languages.</p>
        <h1>What I want out of this class</h1>
        <p>Get basic knowledge of HTML and CSS</p>
    </li>

      <h1>Difference between UX and UI</h1>
      <p>UX stands for User Experience while UI stands for User Interface</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h1>HTML and CSS</h1>
      <p>HTML or Hyper Text Markup Language is the way a website is structured while CSS or Cascading Style Sheet deals with the way how the website is styled</p>

      <h1>DigimonGo</h1>
      <p>DigimonGo was pretty easy, just had to learn how to use hover and border-radius</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h1>Block Family (Media Queries)</h1>
      <p>Probably the hardest project we had to do. I wasn't there to learn media queries on Friday so I had to learn how to use them myself. I couldn't find out how to do the extra credit one. </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h1>Basic Javascript</h1>
      <p>Javascript seems to be pretty easy, so far it's been similar to Python in terms of the learning curve. Doing functions is probably the most fun part of doing javascript</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h1>Conditionals (Alien)</h1>
      <p>At first doing this was pretty hard for me because I tried to do it in a function but then I realized that a function isn't needed, all you had to do was make simple if/else statements.</p>
