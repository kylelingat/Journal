As a club and sport member I know what it feels like to be the only one not ge the memo because lack of communication. Our app solves this by proving a platform for school clubs and sports. It also includes global school features such as lunch menus, bulletins, and student feedback to school. If I wanted to improve my team's video I would try explaining what our app does more rather than skits. Features that we currently have planned are group and individual messaging, membership status for clubs, digital forms, and reminders. Features I would like to add are ways to set due dates and global chat rooms for each school. Challenges our team faces are mostly working together because this is our first year working together and we have such a big group meaning someone has to take command but nobody does. What I would change is how we work together because like I said, we don't have a leader."
